# In JavaScript actions, `dist/` is a special directory. When you reference
# an action with the `uses:` property, `dist/index.js` is the code that will be
# run. For this project, the `dist/index.js` file is transpiled from other
# source files. This workflow ensures the `dist/` directory contains the
# expected transpiled code.
#
# If this workflow is run from a feature branch, it will attempt to automatically
# update dist. Note that you may need to manually restart other workflows due to
# https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-when-your-workflow-runs/triggering-a-workflow#triggering-a-workflow-from-a-workflow
